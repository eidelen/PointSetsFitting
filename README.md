# PointSetsFitting

This is a python implementation of the algorithm "Least-Squares Fitting of two 3d Point Sets". This method can be used to compute the rigid transformation between two sets of corresponding 3D vectors. 


# Point sets and the rigid transformation

In regards to the image below, the 3D vectors in the first point set are defined in the coordinate system A. The corresponding 3D points in the second point set are defined in the coordinate system B. The resulting rigid transformation G connects those two coordinate systems A and B. This is also known as 3D-3D registration.
